## What's unique in this Project

- The Joke teller web app uses `fetch()` API to access two different **REST APIs**. 
- The first **REST API** is used to request for *programming jokes* and receive the data in **JSON format**.
- And the other **REST API** is used to convert the joke text to speech.
- The **Tell Me A Joke** button triggers the **REST APIs** to play the joke audio dynamically based on click events.
- The **Tell Me A Joke** button also doesn't allow for another request for joke untill the first joke is played completely.
